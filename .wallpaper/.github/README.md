# Wallpapers

All, well, or almost all desktop wallpapers are the works of the beautiful
artist Aenami. Maybe they do not always fall into the gruvbox palette, but
each of these works hits me right in the soul. If you like her works, and
you have the opportunity on the links below you can find her credentials
and donate.
