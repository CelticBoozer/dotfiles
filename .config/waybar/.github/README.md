# Waybar

The default status bar for Sway - 'swaybar' although quite minimalistic and
lightweight, is very limited and low-functional. That's why I've chosen [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
as an alternative. Waybar is a more advanced status bar that offers extensive
customization options and additional features.

I tried to style the waybar to look like the vim-airline plugin.

Most of the modules I use are standard modules and you can read information
about them in the official waybar documentation. However, below you can see
a list of custom modules.

- [waybar-crypto](https://github.com/Chadsr/waybar-crypto) - displays the price
  of cryptocurrencies directly on the bar.
- [wttrbar](https://github.com/bjesus/wttrbar) - displays the current weather,
  it uses information from wttr.in.
- [pacman-updates](https://github.com/coffebar/waybar-module-pacman-updates) -
  displays the number of packages for which an update has appeared.
