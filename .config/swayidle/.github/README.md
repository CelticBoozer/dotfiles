# swayidle

[swayidle](https://github.com/swaywm/swayidle/) is a daemon for managing idle
states in the SwayWM. It allows to define actions that trigger after a set
period of inactivity, such as locking the screen, dimming the display, or
suspending the system.

I define swaylock after 15 minutes of inactivity and suspend after 30 minutes
as actions.
