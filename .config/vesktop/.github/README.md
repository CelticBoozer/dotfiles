# Vesktop

[Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop) is a custom desktop client for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/).
Feature rich, with a focus on customization(plugins, themes, etc.) and performance.

As a main theme, I use [sytem24](https://github.com/refact0r/system24), TUI-like
theme with a focus on readability, but a bit customized to my taste and
gruvbox-material palette.
