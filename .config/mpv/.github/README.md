# mpv

[mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) is a highly customizable, open-source
media player that supports a wide range of video, audio, and streaming formats.
It is known for its minimalist design, powerful command-line interface, and
scriptable features.

But the standard interface is extremely archaic and I borrowed
[scripts](https://github.com/Samillion/ModernZ) to improve the user interface.
