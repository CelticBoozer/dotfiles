# Notification center (SwayNC)

[SwayNC](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter) - is a notification
center and daemon designed specifically for the Sway window manager and other
Wayland-based environments. It's pretty lightweight, fast, and functional. Its
main advantage is the availability of a full-fledged notification center.
