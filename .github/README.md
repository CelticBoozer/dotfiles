# Dotfiles

Greetings. Thanks for stopping by. This repository is the repository of my Linux
desktop system configuration. I tried to make my system lightweight, fast, easy
to reconfigure, functional and convenient for both daily use and work. Where it
is possible to use TUI without loss of functionality, I tried to use it. I also
tried to configure all programs in the same color palette.

## Distribution and Environment

### Chosen Linux Distribution

I chose [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) as my distribution because of many
reasons, such as rolling release model, full user control, lightweight and of
course pacman the greatest package manager ever.
